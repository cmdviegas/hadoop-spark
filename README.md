## Hadoop and Spark Cluster Deployment

This script deploys a cluster with `Apache Hadoop 3.4.x` and `Apache Spark 3.5.x` in fully distributed mode using `Docker` containers as the underlying infrastructure. This setup is primarily intended for teaching and experimentation, but it may also be suitable for scalable data processing workloads in controlled environments.

JupyterLab is now integrated, allowing users to interact with the Spark cluster through notebooks, making development, testing, and data exploration more convenient and user-friendly.

### üóÇÔ∏è Architecture

The cluster consists of **one master node** and a configurable number of **worker nodes**, deployed over a custom `Docker` network.

- **Master Node**: `spark-master` ‚Äî responsible for coordinating the cluster, managing resources (via YARN), and serving as the Spark Master and HDFS NameNode.
- **Worker Nodes**: `spark-worker-<id>` ‚Äî replicated containers acting as Spark Workers, HDFS DataNodes, and YARN NodeManagers, where `<id>` denotes the worker instance ID.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Resource Management and Services

The cluster uses **YARN** for resource scheduling and **HDFS** for distributed file storage. Here are the key services on each node:

#### Master Node (`spark-master`)

- **ResourceManager** (YARN)
- **NameNode** (HDFS)
- **Spark Master**
- **Exposed Ports**:
  - `9870` ‚Äì HDFS Web UI
  - `8088` ‚Äì YARN ResourceManager UI
  - `19888` ‚Äì MAPRED Job History UI
  - `18080` ‚Äì Spark History Server UI
  - `15002` ‚Äì Spark Connect
  - `8888` ‚Äì Jupyter Lab

#### Worker Nodes (`spark-worker-<id>`)

- **DataNode** (HDFS)
- **NodeManager** (YARN)
- **Spark Worker**

### :rocket: How to build and run

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: All cluster parameters ‚Äî such as the default user credentials, resource allocation (e.g., memory and CPU limits), number of worker nodes, and other deployment-specific settings ‚Äî are configurable via the `.env` file. This file is the primary configuration source for the cluster setup.

‚ö†Ô∏è Optional (Recommended): Before starting, it is advised to pre-download Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark by running the `download.sh` script. This step will speed up the build process.

#### To build and run:
```
docker compose run --rm gen-compose
docker compose build && docker compose up
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: It is advised to use `Docker Compose 1.18.0` or higher to ensure compatibility.

‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: It is recommended to run `docker compose run --rm gen-compose` command every time `$NUM_WORKER_NODES` variable is changed. This ensures that `docker-compose.yml` file is updated with the new cluster configuration.

### :bulb: Tips

#### Accessing the Master Node

To access the master node, run the following command:
```
docker exec -it spark-master bash
```

### :memo: Changelog

#### 19/05/2025
- :sparkles: For security reasons, the `$MY_PASSWORD` variable has been removed from the `.env` file. A dedicated secrets file (`.password`) has been introduced for setting the user password, if required;
- :sparkles: Each worker node is now deployed as a separate service with a specific hostname (`spark-worker-<id>`). A script generates `docker-compose.yml` dynamically based on `$NUM_WORKER_NODES` variable (change it at `.env` file). A new method for building and running the cluster has been defined. See the updated commands above;
